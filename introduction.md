##Introduction

Asgard is a complete PHP framework which will provide you with most of what you need to build websites. If you need additional packages though, Asgard works with composer, making it easy to use more libraries.

Asgards's priorities are easiness, efficiency and code quality. To achieve the second one especially, it comes with a range of unique functionalities that are not available in most modern PHP frameworks.

By going through this documentation you get detailed information on how to use Asgard as a developer. If you only want a taste of it, try the [quickstart](docs/quickstart).
